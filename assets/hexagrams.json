      "oracle": "\tWorks sublime success,\n\tFurthering through perseverance.",
      "resume": "The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines \nstand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the \nspirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is \nwithout weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its \nenergy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is \ntherefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this \nmotion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power \nof persisting in time, that is, duration.\n\n  The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense \nin terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. \nIn relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action \nof the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of \nthe holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power \nawakens and develops their higher nature.\n\t",
      "judgment": "According to the original meaning, the attributes (sublimity, potentiality of \nsuccess, power to further, perseverance) are paired. When an individual \ndraws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal \ndepths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his \nhappiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what \nis right.\n\n  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of \nspeculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by \"sublime\" \nmeans literally \"head,\" \"origin,\" \"great.\" This is why Confucius says in \nexplaining it: \"Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings \nowe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven.\" For this \nattribute inheres in the other three as well.\n\n  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that \nhave yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend \nform to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and \nthe process is represented by an image from nature: \"The clouds pass and the \nrain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms.\"  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to \nnotable success: \"Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he \ncompletes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them \nat the right time, as though on sic dragons.\" The six steps are the six different \npositions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon \nsymbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and \ngiving actuality to the way of the universe (Tao), which, as a law running \nthrough end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each \nstep attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer \na hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.\n\n  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity \nand success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous \nactualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms \n\"furthering\" (literally, \"creating that which accords with the nature of a \ngiven being\") and \"persevering\" (literally, \"correct and firm\"). \"The course of \nthe Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific \nnature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus \ndoes it show itself to further through perseverance.\"  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace \nand security to the world through his activity in creating order: \"He towers \nhigh above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace.\"  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words \n\"sublime,\" \"success,\" \"furthering,\" \"perseverance,\" and parallels them with \nthe four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the \nfundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the \nattribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize \nexpressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute \nfurthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which \neach receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and \nwhich constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated \nwith wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can \ntherefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already \nbroached in the commentary called Wên Yen , later formed the bridge \nconnecting the philosophy of the \"five stages (elements) of change,\" as laid \ndown in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of \nChanges, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative \nprinciples. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of \nthought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.\n\t",

        "oracle": "The movement of heaven is full of power. \n\tThus the superior man makes himself strong and \n\tuntiring.",
        "image": "Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which \nheaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete \nrevolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means \nthat each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is \nthe same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea \nof duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor \nslackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This \nduration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative. \n  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so \nthat his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way, \nby consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains \nthat tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his \nactivity.\n\t\t"

          "poem": "Nine at the beginning means:\nHidden dragon. Do not act.",
          "expl": "In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again.  Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe."

But danger lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and remains blameless."

      "resume": "This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents \nthe dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the \nhexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of \nTHE CREATIVE—the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does \nnot combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to \nspirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal \nas against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the \nprinciple of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation \nbetween man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and \nbetween father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears \nin the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.\n\n  But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly \ndefined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course \nthe Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of \ndevotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the \nCreative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it \nis productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand \nas an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result \nthen is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of \nevil to both.\n\t",
      "judgment": "The four fundamental aspects of the Creative—\"sublime success, furthering \nthrough perseverance\"—are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however, \nthe perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive \nconnotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. \nThe potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a \nspecifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, \"of a mare,\" is here \nadded to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the \ndragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a \nsymbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because \nthe mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the \ngentleness and devotion of the cow.\n\n  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad \nimpulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness \nlies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to \ngive then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the \nCreative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. \nApplied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in \nconformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an \nindependent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must \nachieve something. It is not his task to try to lead—that would only make him \nlose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an \nattitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man \nlets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the \nsituation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from \nfate.\n\n  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in \nthe hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The \ntime of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south \nsymbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature \ndoes in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all \none's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find \nfriends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and \neffort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The \neast symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and \nthe north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he \nmust be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without \ncompanions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional \nhates and favoritism.\n\t",

The earth in its devotion carries all things, good \nand evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his \ncharacter breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to \nsupport and to bear with people and things.\n\t\t"

In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.  Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions.

On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a \"corpse boy\" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying.

Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way of making success certain. Confucius says about this line:Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion when his affairs are in order.

From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the \ninvisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified \nmankind.\n\n  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated and \nregulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed \nto purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes \nand thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men \ndrew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the theater \ndeveloped). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united with \nthe most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The \nancestors were invited to these divine services as guests of the Ruler of \nHeaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions.

The meaning is then further extended to include \nthe concept of approach, especially the approach of what is lower. Finally the \nmeaning includes the attitude of condescension of a man in high position \ntoward the people, and in general the setting to work on affairs.

These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram \ncan be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.\n\nA tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same \ntime, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen \nfor miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the \nlaw of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by \nmeans of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.\n\n  This hexagram is linked with the eight month (September-October). The \nlight-giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase. \nHowever, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a \nwhole.\n\t",

The moment of \ntime between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of \ndeepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the \ncontemplation of it has a transforming awe-spiring effect on those who \nwitness it.\n\n  Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural \noccurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine \nmeaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is \ncalled upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. This \nrequires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplation \ndevelops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend the \nmysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner \nconcentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus \na hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating \nothers without their being aware of how it happens. \n\n\t",

On the \none hand, such a man will have a view of the real sentiments of the great \nmass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived; on the other, he will \nimpress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of \nhis personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.\n\t\t"

The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus the \nmovement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the \ntransformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is \nintroduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. \nSocieties of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these \ngroups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the \ntime, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. \nThe idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is \ncyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten \nanything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is \nthe meaning of heaven and earth. \n  All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings \nreturn. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, \ncomes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes \nin the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of \nthe young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is \nincreased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.\n\t",

      "oracle": "\tThe Abysmal repeated.\n\tIf you are sincere, you have success in your heart,\n\tAnd whatever you do succeeds.",
      "resume": "This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one of the \neight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means a \nplunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed \nin by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son. \nThe Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K'an \ndevelops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above \nand is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on \nearth.\n\n  In man's world K'an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the \nbody, the principle of light inclosed in the dark—that is, reason. The name of \nthe hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, \n\"repetition of danger.\" Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an \nobjective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective \nattitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness \nor guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in \nwhich a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, \nhe can escape if he behaves correctly.\n\t",
      "judgment": "Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the \nexample for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on, \nand merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink \nfrom any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose \nits own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus \nlikewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can \npenetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner \nmastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will \nsucceed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done-\n-thoroughness—and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in \nthe danger.\n\n  Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective \nmeasure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every \nattempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, \nseparating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to \nprotect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.\n\t",

The superior man follows its example; he is concerned \nthat goodness should be an established attribute of character rather than an \naccidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others everything \ndepends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that the pupil makes \nthe material his own.\n\t\t"

Hasty action \nwould not be wise. This is also true, finally, of any effort to exert influence on \nothers, for here too the essential factor is a correct way of development \nthrough cultivation of one's own personality. No influence such as that \nexerted by agitators has a lasting effect.\n\n  Within the personality too, development must follow the same course if \nlasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same \ntime penetrating, is the outer form that should proceed from inner calm.\n\n  The very gradualness of the development makes it necessary to have \nperseverance, for perseverance alone prevents slow progress from dwindling \nto nothing.\n\t",

After the change is made, it is necessary to note carefully for some time after how the improvements bear the test of actuality. Such careful work is accompanied by good fortune."

Under certain conditions, intimidation \nwithout gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all \ntime. When, on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness, \nthey are led to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need be \nwill not shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.\n\t",

The root of all influence lies in one's own inner being: given true and vigorous expression in word and deed, its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection of something that emanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate intention of an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it. Confucius says about this line:The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken, he meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by!

Thus the superior man \nderives an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more \nclosely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though \nthis might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is \nexceptionally conscientious in his actions. In bereavement emotion means \nmore to him than ceremoniousness. In all his personal expenditures he is \nextremely simple and unpretentious. In comparison with the man of the \nmasses, all this makes him stand out as exceptional. But the essential \nsignificance of his attitude lies in the fact that in external matters he is on the \nside of the lowly.\n\t\t"

This unusual behavior is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex. Hence here deviation from the rule is not a mistake.  Another image is that of the official who, in compliance with regulation, first seeks an audience with his prince. If he is not successful in this, he does not try to force anything but goes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking his place among the other officials. This extraordinary restraint is likewise not a mistake in exceptional times. (The rule is that every official should first have an audience with the prince by whom he is appointed. Here the appointment is made by the minister.)"

Is such times a man must seek out helpers with whose aid he can carry out the task. But these helpers must be modestly sought out in the retirement to which they have withdrawn. It is not in the fame nor their great names but their genuine achievements that are important. Through such modesty the right man is found, and the exceptional task is carried out in spite of all difficulties."

It was regarded as a breach of propriety to drive on if this curtain was lost.  Applied to public life, this means that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times \"after completion\" it may happen that those who have come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering new talent.  This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man's superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: \"Do not seek it.\" Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man's own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord. He need only be able to wait."

The situation described is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especially important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have hade themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking."

However, while man sees what is before his eyes, God looks into the heart. Therefore a simple sacrifice offered with real piety holds a greater blessing than an impressive service without warmth."
